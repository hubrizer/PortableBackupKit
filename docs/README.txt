PortableBackupKit
=================

What it is
----------
A self-contained Windows toolkit that makes automatic, incremental SFTP
backups with rclone.  No installation is required; everything runs from the
folder you unzip.

Main points
-----------
* Mirrors the remote server into current\
* Creates dated snapshots in archive\YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS\
* Keeps only the last 30 days of snapshots (changeable)
* Runs on a schedule you choose (daily, every N hours, or weekly)
* Shows live progress in the console and in backup.log
* Optional Brevo e-mail when a run finishes

Folder layout
